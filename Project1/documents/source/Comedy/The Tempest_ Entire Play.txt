The Tempest Shakespeare homepage | The Tempest | Entire play ACT I
SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
of thunder and lightning heard.
Enter a Master and a Boatswain
Master 
Boatswain!
Boatswain 
Here, master: what cheer?
Master 
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
Exit
Enter Mariners
Boatswain 
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!
Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others
ALONSO 
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.
Boatswain 
I pray now, keep below.
ANTONIO 
Where is the master, boatswain?
Boatswain 
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.
GONZALO 
Nay, good, be patient.
Boatswain 
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
GONZALO 
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Boatswain 
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.
Exit
GONZALO 
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
Exeunt
Re-enter Boatswain
Boatswain 
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A cry within
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
SEBASTIAN 
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!
Boatswain 
Work you then.
ANTONIO 
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
GONZALO 
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.
Boatswain 
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.
Enter Mariners wet
Mariners 
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
Boatswain 
What, must our mouths be cold?
GONZALO 
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.
SEBASTIAN 
I'm out of patience.
ANTONIO 
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
GONZALO 
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.
A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'
ANTONIO 
Let's all sink with the king.
SEBASTIAN 
Let's take leave of him.
Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
GONZALO 
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA 
MIRANDA 
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.
PROSPERO 
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.
MIRANDA 
O, woe the day!
PROSPERO 
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.
MIRANDA 
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
PROSPERO 
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
Lays down his mantle
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.
MIRANDA 
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
PROSPERO 
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.
MIRANDA 
Certainly, sir, I can.
PROSPERO 
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
MIRANDA 
'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?
PROSPERO 
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.
MIRANDA 
But that I do not.
PROSPERO 
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.
MIRANDA 
Sir, are not you my father?
PROSPERO 
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.
MIRANDA 
O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?
PROSPERO 
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.
MIRANDA 
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
PROSPERO 
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?
MIRANDA 
Sir, most heedfully.
PROSPERO 
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
MIRANDA 
O, good sir, I do.
PROSPERO 
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou hear?
MIRANDA 
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
PROSPERO 
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.
MIRANDA 
O the heavens!
PROSPERO 
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.
MIRANDA 
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
PROSPERO 
Now the condition.
The King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.
MIRANDA 
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.
PROSPERO 
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.
MIRANDA 
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?
PROSPERO 
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.
MIRANDA 
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!
PROSPERO 
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.
MIRANDA 
How came we ashore?
PROSPERO 
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.
MIRANDA 
Would I might
But ever see that man!
PROSPERO 
Now I arise:
Resumes his mantle
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
MIRANDA 
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?
PROSPERO 
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
MIRANDA sleeps
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL 
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.
PROSPERO 
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
ARIEL 
To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.
PROSPERO 
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?
ARIEL 
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.'
PROSPERO 
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?
ARIEL 
Close by, my master.
PROSPERO 
But are they, Ariel, safe?
ARIEL 
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.
PROSPERO 
Of the king's ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.
ARIEL 
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.
PROSPERO 
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?
ARIEL 
Past the mid season.
PROSPERO 
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.
ARIEL 
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me.
PROSPERO 
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst demand?
ARIEL 
My liberty.
PROSPERO 
Before the time be out? no more!
ARIEL 
I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.
PROSPERO 
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?
ARIEL 
No.
PROSPERO 
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.
ARIEL 
I do not, sir.
PROSPERO 
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
ARIEL 
No, sir.
PROSPERO 
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
ARIEL 
Sir, in Argier.
PROSPERO 
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
ARIEL 
Ay, sir.
PROSPERO 
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.
ARIEL 
Yes, Caliban her son.
PROSPERO 
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.
ARIEL 
I thank thee, master.
PROSPERO 
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
ARIEL 
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.
PROSPERO 
Do so, and after two days
I will discharge thee.
ARIEL 
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
PROSPERO 
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
Exit ARIEL
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
MIRANDA 
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
PROSPERO 
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.
MIRANDA 
'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.
PROSPERO 
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.
CALIBAN 
[Within] There's wood enough within.
PROSPERO 
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.
ARIEL 
My lord it shall be done.
Exit
PROSPERO 
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
Enter CALIBAN
CALIBAN 
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!
PROSPERO 
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.
CALIBAN 
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.
PROSPERO 
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.
CALIBAN 
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.
PROSPERO 
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
CALIBAN 
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!
PROSPERO 
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
CALIBAN 
No, pray thee.
Aside
I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a vassal of him.
PROSPERO 
So, slave; hence!
Exit CALIBAN
Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following
ARIEL'S song.
Come unto these yellow sands,
And then take hands:
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Hark, hark!
Burthen [dispersedly, within
The watch-dogs bark!
Burthen Bow-wow
Hark, hark! I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
FERDINAND 
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
ARIEL sings
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Burthen Ding-dong
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
FERDINAND 
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
PROSPERO 
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond.
MIRANDA 
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
PROSPERO 
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.
MIRANDA 
I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.
PROSPERO 
[Aside] It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
Within two days for this.
FERDINAND 
Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?
MIRANDA 
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.
FERDINAND 
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.
PROSPERO 
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
FERDINAND 
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.
MIRANDA 
Alack, for mercy!
FERDINAND 
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.
PROSPERO 
[Aside] The Duke of Milan
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
I'll set thee free for this.
To FERDINAND
A word, good sir;
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
MIRANDA 
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!
FERDINAND 
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.
PROSPERO 
Soft, sir! one word more.
Aside
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
To FERDINAND
One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.
FERDINAND 
No, as I am a man.
MIRANDA 
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.
PROSPERO 
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
FERDINAND 
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.
Draws, and is charmed from moving
MIRANDA 
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and not fearful.
PROSPERO 
What? I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.
MIRANDA 
Beseech you, father.
PROSPERO 
Hence! hang not on my garments.
MIRANDA 
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.
PROSPERO 
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.
MIRANDA 
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.
PROSPERO 
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.
FERDINAND 
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.
PROSPERO 
[Aside] It works.
To FERDINAND
Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
To FERDINAND
Follow me.
To ARIEL
Hark what thou else shalt do me.
MIRANDA 
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.
PROSPERO 
Thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.
ARIEL 
To the syllable.
PROSPERO 
Come, follow. Speak not for him.
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Another part of the island.
Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others 
GONZALO 
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.
ALONSO 
Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN 
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
ANTONIO 
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
SEBASTIAN 
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.
GONZALO 
Sir,--
SEBASTIAN 
One: tell.
GONZALO 
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--
SEBASTIAN 
A dollar.
GONZALO 
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.
SEBASTIAN 
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
GONZALO 
Therefore, my lord,--
ANTONIO 
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
ALONSO 
I prithee, spare.
GONZALO 
Well, I have done: but yet,--
SEBASTIAN 
He will be talking.
ANTONIO 
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?
SEBASTIAN 
The old cock.
ANTONIO 
The cockerel.
SEBASTIAN 
Done. The wager?
ANTONIO 
A laughter.
SEBASTIAN 
A match!
ADRIAN 
Though this island seem to be desert,--
SEBASTIAN 
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
ADRIAN 
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
SEBASTIAN 
Yet,--
ADRIAN 
Yet,--
ANTONIO 
He could not miss't.
ADRIAN 
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.
ANTONIO 
Temperance was a delicate wench.
SEBASTIAN 
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
ADRIAN 
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
SEBASTIAN 
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
ANTONIO 
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
GONZALO 
Here is everything advantageous to life.
ANTONIO 
True; save means to live.
SEBASTIAN 
Of that there's none, or little.
GONZALO 
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
ANTONIO 
The ground indeed is tawny.
SEBASTIAN 
With an eye of green in't.
ANTONIO 
He misses not much.
SEBASTIAN 
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
GONZALO 
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--
SEBASTIAN 
As many vouched rarities are.
GONZALO 
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.
ANTONIO 
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?
SEBASTIAN 
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
GONZALO 
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
SEBASTIAN 
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
ADRIAN 
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.
GONZALO 
Not since widow Dido's time.
ANTONIO 
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!
SEBASTIAN 
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you take it!
ADRIAN 
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
GONZALO 
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
ADRIAN 
Carthage?
GONZALO 
I assure you, Carthage.
SEBASTIAN 
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.
ANTONIO 
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
SEBASTIAN 
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.
ANTONIO 
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.
GONZALO 
Ay.
ANTONIO 
Why, in good time.
GONZALO 
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.
ANTONIO 
And the rarest that e'er came there.
SEBASTIAN 
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
ANTONIO 
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
GONZALO 
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.
ANTONIO 
That sort was well fished for.
GONZALO 
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
ALONSO 
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?
FRANCISCO 
Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.
ALONSO 
No, no, he's gone.
SEBASTIAN 
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
ALONSO 
Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN 
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.
ALONSO 
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
GONZALO 
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.
SEBASTIAN 
Very well.
ANTONIO 
And most chirurgeonly.
GONZALO 
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.
SEBASTIAN 
Foul weather?
ANTONIO 
Very foul.
GONZALO 
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
ANTONIO 
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
SEBASTIAN 
Or docks, or mallows.
GONZALO 
And were the king on't, what would I do?
SEBASTIAN 
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
GONZALO 
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--
SEBASTIAN 
Yet he would be king on't.
ANTONIO 
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.
GONZALO 
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.
SEBASTIAN 
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
ANTONIO 
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
GONZALO 
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.
SEBASTIAN 
God save his majesty!
ANTONIO 
Long live Gonzalo!
GONZALO 
And,--do you mark me, sir?
ALONSO 
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
GONZALO 
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.
ANTONIO 
'Twas
