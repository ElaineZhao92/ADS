SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.
Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN 
FERDINAND 
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here:
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
LONGAVILLE 
I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
DUMAIN 
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
With all these living in philosophy.
BIRON 
I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
FERDINAND 
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
BIRON 
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
LONGAVILLE 
You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
BIRON 
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.
FERDINAND 
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
BIRON 
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
FERDINAND 
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
BIRON 
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
FERDINAND 
These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight.
BIRON 
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.
FERDINAND 
How well he's read, to reason against reading!
DUMAIN 
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
LONGAVILLE 
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
BIRON 
The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
DUMAIN 
How follows that?
BIRON 
Fit in his place and time.
DUMAIN 
In reason nothing.
BIRON 
Something then in rhyme.
FERDINAND 
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
BIRON 
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
FERDINAND 
Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
BIRON 
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
FERDINAND 
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
BIRON 
[Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
LONGAVILLE 
Four days ago.
BIRON 
Let's see the penalty.
Reads
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
LONGAVILLE 
Marry, that did I.
BIRON 
Sweet lord, and why?
LONGAVILLE 
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
BIRON 
A dangerous law against gentility!
Reads
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
FERDINAND 
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
BIRON 
So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
FERDINAND 
We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.
BIRON 
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might master'd but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:
Subscribes
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?
FERDINAND 
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain;
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
BIRON 
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
LONGAVILLE 
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study, three years is but short.
Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD
DULL 
Which is the duke's own person?
BIRON 
This, fellow: what wouldst?
DULL 
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood.
BIRON 
This is he.
DULL 
Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
abroad: this letter will tell you more.
COSTARD 
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
FERDINAND 
A letter from the magnificent Armado.
BIRON 
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
LONGAVILLE 
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
BIRON 
To hear? or forbear laughing?
LONGAVILLE 
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
forbear both.
BIRON 
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.
COSTARD 
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
BIRON 
In what manner?
COSTARD 
In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
in some form.
BIRON 
For the following, sir?
COSTARD 
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
the right!
FERDINAND 
Will you hear this letter with attention?
BIRON 
As we would hear an oracle.
COSTARD 
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
and body's fostering patron.'
COSTARD 
Not a word of Costard yet.
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'So it is,'--
COSTARD 
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
telling true, but so.
FERDINAND 
Peace!
COSTARD 
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
FERDINAND 
No words!
COSTARD 
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
COSTARD 
Me?
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
COSTARD 
Me?
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--
COSTARD 
Still me?
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
COSTARD 
O, me!
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
wherewith,--
COSTARD 
With a wench.
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
estimation.'
DULL 
'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
and heart-burning heat of duty.
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
BIRON 
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
that ever I heard.
FERDINAND 
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
you to this?
COSTARD 
Sir, I confess the wench.
FERDINAND 
Did you hear the proclamation?
COSTARD 
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it.
FERDINAND 
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
with a wench.
COSTARD 
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
FERDINAND 
Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
COSTARD 
This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
FERDINAND 
It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
COSTARD 
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
FERDINAND 
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
COSTARD 
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
FERDINAND 
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
a week with bran and water.
COSTARD 
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
FERDINAND 
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practise that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN
BIRON 
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.
COSTARD 
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH 
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
grows melancholy?
MOTH 
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH 
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?
MOTH 
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Why tough senior? why tough senior?
MOTH 
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.
MOTH 
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
old time, which we may name tough.
DON ADRIANO DE
ARMADO 
Pretty and apt.
MOTH 
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
I apt, and my saying pretty?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH 
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH 
Speak you this in my praise, master?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
In thy condign praise.
MOTH 
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
What, that an eel is ingenious?
MOTH 
That an eel is quick.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
MOTH 
I am answered, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I love not to be crossed.
MOTH 
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
MOTH 
You may do it in an hour, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Impossible.
MOTH 
How many is one thrice told?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
MOTH 
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
complete man.
MOTH 
Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
deuce-ace amounts to.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
It doth amount to one more than two.
MOTH 
Which the base vulgar do call three.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
True.
MOTH 
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
will tell you.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
A most fine figure!
MOTH 
To prove you a cipher.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?
MOTH 
Hercules, master.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.
MOTH 
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?
MOTH 
A woman, master.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Of what complexion?
MOTH 
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
MOTH 
Of the sea-water green, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Is that one of the four complexions?
MOTH 
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
MOTH 
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
My love is most immaculate white and red.
MOTH 
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
such colours.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Define, define, well-educated infant.
MOTH 
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!
MOTH 
If she be made of white and red,
Her faults will ne'er be known,
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown:
Then if she fear, or be to blame,
By this you shall not know,
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
white and red.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
MOTH 
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
MOTH 
[Aside] To be whipped; and yet a better love than
my master.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
MOTH 
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I say, sing.
MOTH 
Forbear till this company be past.
Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA
DULL 
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
JAQUENETTA 
Man?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I will visit thee at the lodge.
JAQUENETTA 
That's hereby.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I know where it is situate.
JAQUENETTA 
Lord, how wise you are!
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I will tell thee wonders.
JAQUENETTA 
With that face?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I love thee.
JAQUENETTA 
So I heard you say.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
And so, farewell.
JAQUENETTA 
Fair weather after you!
DULL 
Come, Jaquenetta, away!
Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
be pardoned.
COSTARD 
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
full stomach.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
COSTARD 
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
are but lightly rewarded.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Take away this villain; shut him up.
MOTH 
Come, you transgressing slave; away!
COSTARD 
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
MOTH 
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
COSTARD 
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
that I have seen, some shall see.
MOTH 
What shall some see?
COSTARD 
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
God I have as little patience as another man; and
therefore I can be quiet.
Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT II
SCENE I. The same.
Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants 
BOYET 
Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.
PRINCESS 
Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
BOYET 
Proud of employment, willingly I go.
PRINCESS 
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Exit BOYET
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
First Lord 
Lord Longaville is one.
PRINCESS 
Know you the man?
MARIA 
I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.
PRINCESS 
Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
MARIA 
They say so most that most his humours know.
PRINCESS 
Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?
KATHARINE 
The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.
ROSALINE 
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal:
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
PRINCESS 
God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
First Lord 
Here comes Boyet.
Re-enter BOYET
PRINCESS 
Now, what admittance, lord?
BOYET 
Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Here comes Navarre.
Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants
FERDINAND 
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
PRINCESS 
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
FERDINAND 
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
PRINCESS 
I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
FERDINAND 
Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
PRINCESS 
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
FERDINAND 
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
PRINCESS 
Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
FERDINAND 
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
PRINCESS 
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
FERDINAND 
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
PRINCESS 
You will the sooner, that I were away;
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
BIRON 
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
ROSALINE 
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
BIRON 
I know you did.
ROSALINE 
How needless was it then to ask the question!
BIRON 
You must not be so quick.
ROSALINE 
'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
BIRON 
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
ROSALINE 
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
BIRON 
What time o' day?
ROSALINE 
The hour that fools should ask.
BIRON 
Now fair befall your mask!
ROSALINE 
Fair fall the face it covers!
BIRON 
And send you many lovers!
ROSALINE 
Amen, so you be none.
BIRON 
Nay, then will I be gone.
FERDINAND 
Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.
PRINCESS 
You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
FERDINAND 
I do protest I never heard of it;
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.
PRINCESS 
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.
FERDINAND 
Satisfy me so.
BOYET 
So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
FERDINAND 
It shall suffice me: at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.
PRINCESS 
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
FERDINAND 
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
Exit
BIRON 
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
ROSALINE 
Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
BIRON 
I would you heard it groan.
ROSALINE 
Is the fool sick?
BIRON 
Sick at the heart.
ROSALINE 
Alack, let it blood.
BIRON 
Would that do it good?
ROSALINE 
My physic says 'ay.'
BIRON 
Will you prick't with your eye?
ROSALINE 
No point, with my knife.
BIRON 
Now, God save thy life!
ROSALINE 
And yours from long living!
BIRON 
I cannot stay thanksgiving.
Retiring
DUMAIN 
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
BOYET 
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
DUMAIN 
A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
Exit
LONGAVILLE 
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
BOYET 
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
LONGAVILLE 
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
BOYET 
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
LONGAVILLE 
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
BOYET 
Her mother's, I have heard.
LONGAVILLE 
God's blessing on your beard!
BOYET 
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.
LONGAVILLE 
Nay, my choler is ended.
She is a most sweet lady.
BOYET 
Not unlike, sir, that may be.
Exit LONGAVILLE
BIRON 
What's her name in the cap?
BOYET 
Rosaline, by good hap.
BIRON 
Is she wedded or no?
BOYET 
To her will, sir, or so.
BIRON 
You are welcome, sir: adieu.
BOYET 
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
Exit BIRON
MARIA 
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
Not a word with him but a jest.
BOYET 
And every jest but a word.
PRINCESS 
It was well done of you to take him at his word.
BOYET 
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
MARIA 
Two hot sheeps, marry.
BOYET 
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
MARIA 
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
BOYET 
So you grant pasture for me.
Offering to kiss her
MARIA 
Not so, gentle beast:
My lips are no common, though several they be.
BOYET 
Belonging to whom?
MARIA 
To my fortunes and me.
PRINCESS 
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
BOYET 
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
PRINCESS 
With what?
BOYET 
With that which we lovers entitle affected.
PRINCESS 
Your reason?
BOYET 
Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
PRINCESS 
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
BOYET 
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
ROSALINE 
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
MARIA 
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
ROSALINE 
Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
BOYET 
Do you hear, my mad wenches?
MARIA 
No.
BOYET 
What then, do you see?
ROSALINE 
Ay, our way to be gone.
BOYET 
You are too hard for me.
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT III
SCENE I. The same.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH 
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
MOTH 
Concolinel.
Singing
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
MOTH 
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
How meanest thou? brawling in French?
MOTH 
No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
these; and make them men of note--do you note
me?--that most are affected to these.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
How hast thou purchased this experience?
MOTH 
By my penny of observation.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
But O,--but O,--
MOTH 
'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
MOTH 
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Almost I had.
MOTH 
Negligent student! learn her by heart.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
By heart and in heart, boy.
MOTH 
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
What wilt thou prove?
MOTH 
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
because your heart is in love with her; and out of
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I am all these three.
MOTH 
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
all.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
MOTH 
A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
for an ass.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
MOTH 
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
The way is but short: away!
MOTH 
As swift as lead, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
MOTH 
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I say lead is slow.
MOTH 
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
I shoot thee at the swain.
MOTH 
Thump then and I flee.
Exit
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.
Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD
MOTH 
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
COSTARD 
No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
the word l'envoy for a salve?
MOTH 
Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
MOTH 
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
MOTH 
Until the goose came out of door,
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l'envoy.
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.
MOTH 
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
desire more?
COSTARD 
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
MOTH 
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
COSTARD 
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
MOTH 
I will tell you sensibly.
COSTARD 
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
We will talk no more of this matter.
COSTARD 
Till there be more matter in the shin.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
COSTARD 
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
some goose, in this.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
restrained, captivated, bound.
COSTARD 
True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
bear this significant
Giving a letter
to the country maid Jaquenetta:
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
Exit
MOTH 
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
COSTARD 
My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
Exit MOTH
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
never buy and sell out of this word.
Enter BIRON
BIRON 
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
COSTARD 
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
buy for a remuneration?
BIRON 
What is a remuneration?
COSTARD 
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
BIRON 
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
COSTARD 
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
BIRON 
Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
COSTARD 
When would you have it done, sir?
BIRON 
This afternoon.
COSTARD 
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
BIRON 
Thou knowest not what it is.
COSTARD 
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
BIRON 
Why, villain, thou must know first.
COSTARD 
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
BIRON 
It must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
Giving him a shilling
COSTARD 
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
Exit
BIRON 
And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
Exit
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT IV
SCENE I. The same.
Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE 
PRINCESS 
Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
Against the steep uprising of the hill?
BOYET 
I know not; but I think it was not he.
PRINCESS 
Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in?
Forester 
Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
PRINCESS 
I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
Forester 
Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
PRINCESS 
What, what? first praise me and again say no?
O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
Forester 
Yes, madam, fair.
PRINCESS 
Nay, never paint me now:
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
Forester 
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
PRINCESS 
See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
And shooting well is then accounted ill.
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
And out of question so it is sometimes,
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
We bend to that the working of the heart;
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
BOYET 
Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?
PRINCESS 
Only for praise: and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord.
BOYET 
Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
Enter COSTARD
COSTARD 
God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
PRINCESS 
Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
COSTARD 
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
PRINCESS 
The thickest and the tallest.
COSTARD 
The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
PRINCESS 
What's your will, sir? what's your will?
COSTARD 
I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
PRINCESS 
O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
Break up this capon.
BOYET 
I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
It is writ to Jaquenetta.
PRINCESS 
We will read it, I swear.
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
Reads
BOYET 
'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
PRINCESS 
What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
BOYET 
I am much deceived but I remember the style.
PRINCESS 
Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
BOYET 
This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the prince and his bookmates.
PRINCESS 
Thou fellow, a word:
Who gave thee this letter?
COSTARD 
I told you; my lord.
PRINCESS 
To whom shouldst thou give it?
COSTARD 
From my lord to my lady.
PRINCESS 
From which lord to which lady?
COSTARD 
From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.
PRINCESS 
Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
To ROSALINE
Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
Exeunt PRINCESS and train
BOYET 
Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
ROSALINE 
Shall I teach you to know?
BOYET 
Ay, my continent of beauty.
ROSALINE 
Why, she that bears the bow.
Finely put off!
BOYET 
My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!
ROSALINE 
Well, then, I am the shooter.
BOYET 
And who is your deer?
ROSALINE 
If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
Finely put on, indeed!
MARIA 
You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
at the brow.
BOYET 
But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
ROSALINE 
Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
touching the hit it?
BOYET 
So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
wench, as touching the hit it.
ROSALINE 
Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
Thou canst not hit it, my good man.
BOYET 
An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
An I cannot, another can.
Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE
COSTARD 
By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!
MARIA 
A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
BOYET 
A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
MARIA 
Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
COSTARD 
Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
BOYET 
An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
COSTARD 
Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
MARIA 
Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
COSTARD 
She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
BOYET 
I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
Exeunt BOYET and MARIA
COSTARD 
By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
vulgar wit!
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
were, so fit.
Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
will swear!
And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
Sola, sola!
Shout within

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
SCENE II. The same.
Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL 
SIR NATHANIEL 
Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
of a good conscience.
HOLOFERNES 
The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
the soil, the land, the earth.
SIR NATHANIEL 
Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
HOLOFERNES 
Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
DULL 
'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
HOLOFERNES 
Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
insert again my haud credo for a deer.
DULL 
I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.
HOLOFERNES 
Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
SIR NATHANIEL 
Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
the duller parts:
And such barren plants are set before us, that we
thankful should be,
Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he.
For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
DULL 
You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
weeks old as yet?
HOLOFERNES 
Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
DULL 
What is Dictynna?
SIR NATHANIEL 
A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
HOLOFERNES 
The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
And raught not to five weeks when he came to
five-score.
The allusion holds in the exchange.
DULL 
'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
HOLOFERNES 
God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
in the exchange.
DULL 
And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
HOLOFERNES 
Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
SIR NATHANIEL 
Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility.
HOLOFERNES 
I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
pleasing pricket;
Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
sore with shooting.
The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
from thicket;
Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
one sorel.
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
SIR NATHANIEL 
A rare talent!
DULL 
[Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
him with a talent.
HOLOFERNES 
This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
thankful for it.
SIR NATHANIEL 
Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
HOLOFERNES 
Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA 
God give you good morrow, master Parson.
HOLOFERNES 
Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
pierced, which is the one?
COSTARD 
Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
HOLOFERNES 
Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
JAQUENETTA 
Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
HOLOFERNES 
Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
Venetia, Venetia,
Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
SIR NATHANIEL 
Ay, sir, and very learned.
HOLOFERNES 
Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
SIR NATHANIEL 
[Reads]
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
osiers bow'd.
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
Where all those pleasures live that art would
comprehend:
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
HOLOFERNES 
You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
was this directed to you?
JAQUENETTA 
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
queen's lords.
HOLOFERNES 
I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.
JAQUENETTA 
Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
COSTARD 
Have with thee, my girl.
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
SIR NATHANIEL 
Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--
HOLOFERNES 
Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
colours. But to return to the verses: did they
please you, Sir Nathaniel?
SIR NATHANIEL 
Marvellous well for the pen.
HOLOFERNES 
I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
beseech your society.
SIR NATHANIEL 
And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
the happiness of life.
HOLOFERNES 
And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
To DULL
Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
their game, and we will to our recreation.
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
SCENE III. The same.
Enter BIRON, with a paper 
BIRON 
The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
with a paper: God give him grace to groan!
Stands aside
Enter FERDINAND, with a paper
FERDINAND 
Ay me!
BIRON 
[Aside] Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
left pap. In faith, secrets!
FERDINAND 
[Reads]
So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
And they thy glory through my grief will show:
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
Steps aside
What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
BIRON 
Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper
LONGAVILLE 
Ay me, I am forsworn!
BIRON 
Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
FERDINAND 
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
BIRON 
One drunkard loves another of the name.
LONGAVILLE 
Am I the first that have been perjured so?
BIRON 
I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
LONGAVILLE 
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
BIRON 
O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.
LONGAVILLE 
This same shall go.
Reads
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
To lose an oath to win a paradise?
BIRON 
This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.
LONGAVILLE 
By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
Steps aside
BIRON 
All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
Enter DUMAIN, with a paper
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
DUMAIN 
O most divine Kate!
BIRON 
O most profane coxcomb!
DUMAIN 
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
BIRON 
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
DUMAIN 
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
BIRON 
An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
DUMAIN 
As upright as the cedar.
BIRON 
Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.
DUMAIN 
As fair as day.
BIRON 
Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
DUMAIN 
O that I had my wish!
LONGAVILLE 
And I had mine!
FERDINAND 
And I mine too, good Lord!
BIRON 
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
DUMAIN 
I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
BIRON 
A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
DUMAIN 
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
BIRON 
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
DUMAIN 
[Reads]
On a day--alack the day!--
Love, whose month is ever May,
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air:
Through the velvet leaves the wind,
All unseen, can passage find;
That the lover, sick to death,
Wish himself the heaven's breath.
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
Air, would I might triumph so!
But, alack, my hand is sworn
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
Do not call it sin in me,
That I am forsworn for thee;
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were;
And deny himself for Jove,
Turning mortal for thy love.
This will I send, and something else more plain,
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
For none offend where all alike do dote.
LONGAVILLE 
[Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
FERDINAND 
[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
You chide at him, offending twice as much;
You do not love Maria; Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
To LONGAVILLE
You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
To DUMAIN
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.
BIRON 
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
Advancing
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!
FERDINAND 
Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
BIRON 
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?
FERDINAND 
Soft! whither away so fast?
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
BIRON 
I post from love: good lover, let me go.
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA 
God bless the king!
FERDINAND 
What present hast thou there?
COSTARD 
Some certain treason.
FERDINAND 
What makes treason here?
COSTARD 
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
FERDINAND 
If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.
JAQUENETTA 
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
FERDINAND 
Biron, read it over.
Giving him the paper
Where hadst thou it?
JAQUENETTA 
Of Costard.
FERDINAND 
Where hadst thou it?
COSTARD 
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
BIRON tears the letter
FERDINAND 
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
BIRON 
A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
LONGAVILLE 
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
DUMAIN 
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
Gathering up the pieces
BIRON 
[To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
FERDINAND 
What?
BIRON 
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
DUMAIN 
Now the number is even.
BIRON 
True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?
FERDINAND 
Hence, sirs; away!
COSTARD 
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
BIRON 
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
FERDINAND 
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
BIRON 
Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?
FERDINAND 
What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
BIRON 
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
FERDINAND 
By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
BIRON 
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look:
No face is fair that is not full so black.
FERDINAND 
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
BIRON 
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
DUMAIN 
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
LONGAVILLE 
And since her time are colliers counted bright.
FERDINAND 
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
DUMAIN 
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
BIRON 
Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.
FERDINAND 
'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.
BIRON 
I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
FERDINAND 
No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
DUMAIN 
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
LONGAVILLE 
Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
BIRON 
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
DUMAIN 
O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
FERDINAND 
But what of this? are we not all in love?
BIRON 
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
FERDINAND 
Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
DUMAIN 
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
LONGAVILLE 
O, some authority how to proceed;
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
DUMAIN 
Some salve for perjury.
BIRON 
'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfills the law,
And who can sever love from charity?
FERDINAND 
Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
BIRON 
Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
In conflict that you get the sun of them.
LONGAVILLE 
Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
FERDINAND 
And win them too: therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.
BIRON 
First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
FERDINAND 
Away, away! no time shall be omitted
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
BIRON 
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT V
SCENE I. The same.
Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL 
HOLOFERNES 
Satis quod sufficit.
SIR NATHANIEL 
I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
HOLOFERNES 
Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
SIR NATHANIEL 
A most singular and choice epithet.
Draws out his table-book
HOLOFERNES 
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
SIR NATHANIEL 
Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
HOLOFERNES 
Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
'twill serve.
SIR NATHANIEL 
Videsne quis venit?
HOLOFERNES 
Video, et gaudeo.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Chirrah!
To MOTH
HOLOFERNES 
Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Men of peace, well encountered.
HOLOFERNES 
Most military sir, salutation.
MOTH 
[Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast
of languages, and stolen the scraps.
COSTARD 
O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
for thou art not so long by the head as
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
swallowed than a flap-dragon.
MOTH 
Peace! the peal begins.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
[To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?
MOTH 
Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
HOLOFERNES 
Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
MOTH 
Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
HOLOFERNES 
Quis, quis, thou consonant?
MOTH 
The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
the fifth, if I.
HOLOFERNES 
I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
MOTH 
The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
MOTH 
Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
HOLOFERNES 
What is the figure? what is the figure?
MOTH 
Horns.
HOLOFERNES 
Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
MOTH 
Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
COSTARD 
An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
ends, as they say.
HOLOFERNES 
O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
charge-house on the top of the mountain?
HOLOFERNES 
Or mons, the hill.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
HOLOFERNES 
I do, sans question.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
affection to congratulate the princess at her
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
rude multitude call the afternoon.
HOLOFERNES 
The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
assure you, sir, I do assure.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
head: and among other important and most serious
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
crave your assistance.
HOLOFERNES 
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
Nine Worthies.
SIR NATHANIEL 
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
HOLOFERNES 
Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
page, Hercules,--
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
HOLOFERNES 
Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
MOTH 
An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
For the rest of the Worthies?--
HOLOFERNES 
I will play three myself.
MOTH 
Thrice-worthy gentleman!
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Shall I tell you a thing?
HOLOFERNES 
We attend.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
beseech you, follow.
HOLOFERNES 
Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
DULL 
Nor understood none neither, sir.
HOLOFERNES 
Allons! we will employ thee.
DULL 
I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
HOLOFERNES 
Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
SCENE II. The same.
Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA 
PRINCESS 
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in:
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.
ROSALINE 
Madame, came nothing else along with that?
PRINCESS 
Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
ROSALINE 
That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
KATHARINE 
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
ROSALINE 
You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
KATHARINE 
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
And so she died: had she been light, like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
ROSALINE 
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
KATHARINE 
A light condition in a beauty dark.
ROSALINE 
We need more light to find your meaning out.
KATHARINE 
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
ROSALINE 
Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
KATHARINE 
So do not you, for you are a light wench.
ROSALINE 
Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
KATHARINE 
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
ROSALINE 
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
PRINCESS 
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
Who sent it? and what is it?
ROSALINE 
I would you knew:
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
My favour were as great; be witness this.
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
PRINCESS 
Any thing like?
ROSALINE 
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
PRINCESS 
Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
KATHARINE 
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
ROSALINE 
'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O, that your face were not so full of O's!
KATHARINE 
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
PRINCESS 
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
KATHARINE 
Madam, this glove.
PRINCESS 
Did he not send you twain?
KATHARINE 
Yes, madam, and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
MARIA 
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.
PRINCESS 
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?
MARIA 
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
PRINCESS 
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
ROSALINE 
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.
PRINCESS 
None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
ROSALINE 
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
MARIA 
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
PRINCESS 
Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
Enter BOYET
BOYET 
O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
PRINCESS 
Thy news Boyet?
BOYET 
Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
PRINCESS 
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
BOYET 
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'T
