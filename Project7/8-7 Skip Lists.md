## 8-7 Skip Lists

Skip list is a data structure that supports both searching and insertion in *O*(*l**o**g**N*) expected time.

This project requires you to introduce the skip lists, and to implement insertion, deletion, and searching in skip lists. A formal proof is expected to show that the expected time for the skip list operations is *O*(*l**o**g**N*). You must generate test cases of different sizes to illustrate the time bound.

##### Grading Policy:

**Programming:** Implement the functions (6 pts.). Write a test of performance program (1 pts.). **All the codes must be sufficiently commented.**

**Testing:** Generate the test cases and give the run time table (2 pts.). Plot the run times vs. input sizes for illustration (2 pts.). Write analysis and comments with the proofs (5 pts.). The analysis must be based on your testing results.

**Documentation:** Chapter 1 (1 pt.), Chapter 2 (2 pts.), and finally a complete report (1 point for overall style of documentation).
